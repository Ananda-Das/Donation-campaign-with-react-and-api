In a world where food systems are under increasing strain, with challenges such as hunger, malnutrition, and environmental degradation, the call for better food is more critical than ever. Improving food for everyone involves a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, it means ensuring that every person has access to nutritious and affordable food. Hunger should be eradicated, and food security should be a basic human right. No one should go to bed hungry, and no child should suffer from malnutrition.",
